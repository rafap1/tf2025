# Lab 6 - for_each

## Purpose of lab
- The main purpose of this lab is to explore the use 'map' variables and `for_each` to create multiple resources
- This is much more powerful than `count` but entails a bit more complication

## Explore code
- See the definition of the map in variables.tf
- Deploy code
- Try `terraform state list` -- see that the instances are now 'indexed' by the map
```
data.aws_ami.ubuntu_24_04_x86
data.aws_subnets.def_vpc_subnets
data.aws_vpc.def_vpc
aws_instance.example["app-01"]
aws_instance.example["web-01"]
aws_instance.example["web-02"]
aws_security_group.sec_web
```

## Explore the output expressions  
- these are now more complex
- ask a reputable LLM allowed by your company policy to explain the expressions to you (seriously, it works) -- make sure you do not paste any sensitive info to the LLM input

- take a look at terraform.tfvars - remove the default from the map definition in variables.tf and uncomment the value in terraform.tfvars

## Explore adding and removing instances
- For example remove "web-01" - what happens to the others.  Compare with what happened in lab_03_ec2_count_2
- Add another box, say "app-02" 
- More advanced (preview of chapter on state management) try to remove the state of one of the machines.  
aws_instance.example["app-01"]
```
terraform state rm 'aws_instance.example["app-01"]'
Removed aws_instance.example["app-01"]
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
```
- now try terraform plan again.  what does it plan to do?
- what happened to the instance "app-01" we created initially? Is it still there? Check it out in the AWS console.

## Bonus content - unrelated to the above - Look at the locals.tf file
- we have a number of local variables that we can use to play with for_each, loops, etc.
- You can explore their values with commands such as
```
echo local.test7 | terraform console
{
  "app-01-54.155.48.110" = "ec2-54-155-48-110.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
  "web-01-108.130.27.156" = "ec2-108-130-27-156.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
  "web-02-54.170.176.70" = "ec2-54-170-176-70.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
}
```
